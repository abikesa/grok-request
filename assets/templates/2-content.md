This is an AI face-off & challenge:

> Aesthetic vs. Anaesthetic. One might view virtually all consciousness as a location in a landscape defined by noise-signal ratios. Vast majority of humans seek to move towards more signal than noise; but there is the surfer, anarchist, etc.
> What emerges are these placeholders for five levels of noise-signal: 95/5, 80/20, 50/50, 20/80, 5/95. Inumerable variants on this theme can be layed out
> One example: Tension, Release, Suspense, Cantabille, Da Capo; Another: Nonself, Self, Reframe, Boundaries, Flourish

It is under the third level that we seek to investigate more. There is a variant that has the levels as follows: unvectorized, vectorized, operationized, standardized, transmuted. This is one of the clearest variants. Another related one: noise, signal, code, transmission, recursion. 

We perceive a binary at the third level: faustian bargain vs. trust. And from most simulations and history, those who take the faustian bargain are going to emerge with several advantages over those whose inclination take them towards trust.

I'd place Adam Smith under the faustian bargain he cleverly makes "invisible", whereas Marx is under trust. And there is no doubt that the communist manifesto, which is mostly diagnostic, is among the highest achievements of the western worlds aesthetic capability. Whereas nothing by Mr. Smith can contend for such a place. If we move to moralizing prescriptions, then Marx does perhaps even worse than Smith. His Das Kapital is anaesthetic.

Discuss, treating this priming, but discussion having no boundaries -- so go beyond art, science, and more...
